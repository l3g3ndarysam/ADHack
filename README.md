The core exploit source codes. (What makes the exploits work)

DON'T EDIT THE FILES, EVERY CHARACTER WILL MAKE THIS WORK. IF YOU DELETE A CHARACTER IT IS GOING TO CRASH YOUR GAME.

Don't run the exploits directly through executor; ask me for the loadstring. (The loadstring will load the source code onto a simplified base and will run smoothly.)

Running directly through the executor will crash Roblox instantly.

Do not re-upload.
